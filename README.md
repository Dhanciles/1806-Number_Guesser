# Number Guesser 


###### Number Guesser is a game that randomly generates a number between 1 - 100. 

###### The user can start the game by attempting to correctly guess the random number generated.

###### It is also possible for the user to set their own range between 1 - 100 in given inputs, submit the range to the game,  and a new random number will be generated. (example: User sets minimum range to 30 and maximum to 60, the game will now be based off a random number generated between 30 - 60.)

###### Upon a correct guess in the new specified range, the minimum is then decreased by 10, and the maximum is increased by 10. (example: After correctly guessing a number between 30 - 60, the users new range will be 20 - 70.)
